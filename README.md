# State-Machine-Combination-Lock
A project using the understanding of state machines in order to create a combination lock that only opens with the input of a personalized student id. 

This project was part of the Digital Logic and Design course during my sophomore year at Rutgers University. It was extremely helpful in order to understand how karnaugh maps and state machines can be used in everyday life. Learning the concepts is always cool but being able to see the real world applications is extremely exciting.
